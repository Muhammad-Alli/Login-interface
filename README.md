# Login-interface

A simple, beginner-friendly login page built with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. The app features a styled login form with username and password inputs, error feedback, and social media icon links — all presented in a clean, responsive layout. It checks hardcoded credentials (John / 1234) in the browser without a backend and includes UI elements like a “forgot password” link, styled buttons and social login icons (non-functional placeholders).
This project demonstrates fundamental web development skills including form validation, CSS styling, and layout design.
